# Parkinson's Disease Classification using Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (RKAN)

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of Parkinson's Disease (PD) using a novel deep learning approach based on the **Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (RKAN)**. The methodology leverages the RKAN architecture to achieve accurate and efficient classification using medical imaging and/or tabular datasets.

The project aims to aid in early diagnosis and improve treatment planning for patients with Parkinson's Disease.

## Features

- Implementation of the RKAN architecture for classification tasks.
- Use of medical imaging datasets (e.g., brain MRI) or other PD-related datasets.
- Preprocessing pipeline for data normalization and augmentation.
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Dataset

The project uses the **PPMI dataset** (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative), which contains medical imaging and clinical data for Parkinson's Disease research.
